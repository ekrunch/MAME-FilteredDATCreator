# MAME-FilteredDATCreator

This script uses XSLT to create a filtered MAME DAT files for use in ROM validation tools. It's source data is generated by MAME itself, either by downloading the "Full driver information in XML format" from [mamedev.org](https://www.mamedev.org/) or by running the MAME executable with the -listxml / -lx parameter as documented in the [MAME docs](https://docs.mamedev.org/commandline/commandline-all.html#frontend-verbs).

### How to use :

- Customize the template files in templates/
  - See the [documentation](templates/README.md)
- Extract or Download the MAME XML file and place it somewhere (I use the dat/ subdirectory for my tests but it doesn't matter)
- Execute the createDats.sh script
  - Example : createDats.sh dat/mame0281.xml
- View output in the output/ directory.
- Import DAT files into your favorite tool (ROMVault, Igir, etc) - Don't forget to set your split/merged settings before organizing ROMs. :)
